Answer Text Evaluation Standards
1. Relevance: The relationship between the question and the answer
Good standard: The question and the large model-generated answer are related. The theme and data of the answer text are related to the question.
Scoring standards for the relationship between the question and the answer:
0 points: The answer text is irrelevant to the question.
1 point: The theme and data of the answer text are related to the question.
2. Fluency
Requirements: The answer text is fluent. The main idea is clear, and the grammar is reasonable.
Scoring standards for fluency:
0 points: The text may have grammatical errors, spelling errors, or improper use of punctuation. The text may be vague, making it difficult for the reader to understand.
1 point: The text may have some grammatical errors, but it is still understandable overall. The text may have some issues with clarity, but it is still understandable overall.
2 points: The text has no obvious errors in grammar and spelling. The text is clear and easy to understand.
3. Coherence
Evaluate whether the answer text itself is in line with common sense and logical, and the text paragraphs are organized reasonably.
3.1 Common sense: Economic common sense, scientific common sense, technical common sense, legal common sense, etc.
An example of economic common sense: When the price of a product increases, the demand for the product will decrease, and the market share of the product will decrease.
3.2 Logical, text paragraphs are organized reasonably: Give a conclusion first, then analyze. Point out, clear and logical. Data is consistent before and after the text.
Bad example: The values of the indicators in the answer text do not match before and after the text. The text mentions that the income in 2020 and 2021 is 100 yuan and 200 yuan respectively. The text mentions that the income in 2020 and 2021 is 200 yuan and 100 yuan respectively. The wrong place is that the income in 2020 and 2021 is contradictory before and after the text.
Scoring standards for coherence:
0 points: The answer text is incoherent, violates common sense, and contradicts itself before and after the text.
1 point: The answer text content is in line with common sense.
2 points: The answer text content is in line with common sense, logical, and the text paragraphs are organized reasonably.
4. Helpfulness
First point: The answer text contains detailed information, preferably with data.
Second point: The answer text contains a clear conclusion, not a vague conclusion.
Third point: The analysis object of the answer text must be consistent with the object in the question, without deviation.
Bad example: The theme of the question is an industry department, but the answer only involves the situation of a company.
Fourth point: There must be logical connections between the paragraphs of the answer text. Each paragraph's topic sentence should be coherent, forming a logical chain supporting the viewpoint.
Fifth point: The answer text involves every aspect mentioned in the question.
Example: If the question requires a table first, then a comprehensive analysis, the answer should have a table first, then text; the answer cannot only have a table or only have text.
Example: If the question requires an analysis of the company's historical income, then predict future income, the answer should have historical income first, then mention future income. The answer cannot only have historical income.
Scoring standards for helpfulness:
1 point for each point satisfied, 5 points for all five points satisfied.
